The initial pod garnered greater traffic than the second one, largely due to minikube service directing most requests 
to the former, while the latter mainly handled healthcheck requests. Implementing a load balancer could have led to a 
more balanced distribution of traffic across both pods.

### Ordering guarantees

Ordering guarantees aren't essential for the app since we can freely initiate multiple pods simultaneously, given that 
each pod operates independently of the others.
