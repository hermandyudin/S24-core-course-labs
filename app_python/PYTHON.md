# Python Web Application Details

## Chosen Framework: Flask

I have chosen Flask because it is quite simple, so it is suitable for this small web application.

## Best Practices Applied:

- Used a virtual environment for dependency management.
- Followed PEP 8 coding standards.
- Ensured code quality by applying modular design principles.
- Tested my app manually (on local machine)

## Code Quality:

The code has been linted using Flake8 to ensure adherence to PEP 8 standards.
